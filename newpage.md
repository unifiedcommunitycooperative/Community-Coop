## How do cooperatives work? 

### The cooperative should provide on a consistent basis, a good or service. 

For example, the Somerville Yogurt Making Cooperative 
1. Is primarily self-funded: The cooperative should be funded primarily by the people who use the good or service. In this way, there is no distinction between consumers and producers leading to shared objectives. 
2. No fundraising: This creates a division between, producers, consumers and funders. 
3. Has a flat managerial structure: There is no single person in charge. 
4. No paid staff

**Product (produces a good or service on a regular basis that is used by the community) + Members of the community have agreed to work together to sustainably manage, produce, fund and consume a good or service on a consistent basis.**  

Cost efficiency of mass production and the time efficiency of DIY

Producers: Producers as consumers
Consumers: Consumers as funders (by not paying for your service or being directly responsible in its production)
Managers: as producers and consumers (not most cooperatives)
Funders: When you rely on external funding you create competition for funding, you create serve the funder not just consumer, you create a role of fundraising to feed fundraising
Scale: Working together
Production: Consistent production
Independence: Sustainable production (not competitive)

When you make dinner for yourself you are acting as both the producer and the consumer. There is not external force that has an interest in what you produce and so you produce what might be considered a pure product that serves you best. The downside of this sort of independent production is that it is highly inefficient both in terms of time. At the other extreme you have commercial production. In this case you act only as consumer. The downside is that you have less control over the product (as less perfect product) and the cost is very high. In the community cooperative, you have the benefit of producing a product for yourself and the benefit of scale.

Commercial production needs consumers // Non-profit production needs funders

In the community driven cooperative, the four basic roles of producer, funder, manager and consumer found in standard economic models are all performed by each member of the cooperative. 

**Producers are producing the product that best fits their need. Not the one the produces the most profit or meets the needs of the funders.** 

Working together, the cooperative is benefiting from collaboration and scale in a non-competitive manner. 

Producer: The producer is the person actually responsible for creating the good or providing the service. In the case of yogurt, it is the person who makes the yogurt. In the case of the bike kitchen it is the person who helps you fix your bike. 

Consistency: Producing 20 quarts of yogurt on a weekly basis, versus some neighbors getting together for a quilting bee.

No external funders: The problem with external funders is that they rarely have good insight into the needs of the producers or consumers, but because they are funders the yield a disproportionate amount of power. This can lead to mission misdirection.

No external consumer/funder: External consumers are generally disengaged from the process of production so are often not getting their needs met. In addition, when consumers are not paying for their goods and services they are not only  completely at the mercy of the producers they do not benefit from the pride of production.

No external producers: While capitalism works as a driving force, the force that drives the production of a good or service is profit and not necessarily the product itself or the needs of the consumer.
